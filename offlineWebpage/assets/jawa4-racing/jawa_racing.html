                    <p class="lead section-lead">Historically JAWA had been very active in racing, and by far the most active East-European manufacturers in mechanical sports. In track racing JAWA sustained a presence in the World Championship until the mid-sixties with respectable performances considering their limited budget. In Motocross the firm built an impressive palmares before its four-stroke engines became superseded by two-stroke engines. In speedway racing, dirt track racing and ice racing where four-stroke engines were still at an advantage, the firm remained a dominant force.</p>

Apparently the Jawa model 11 made a pretty good motocrosser for it's time. In fact Gaston Sauteur rode his Jawa Springer to the 1954 Swiss moto-cross championship.</p>

They featured increased power and lighter weight over the ISDT models (250cc = 276 LB, 350cc=298 LB), and had close ratio transmissions. These Jawa’s were also raced very successfully in the late 50’s & early 60’s by American racers Walt Axthelm, Joe Bolger, Bill Messer, Kenny Clark, and Bill Chabot. Jawa’s won the 250 class at the Tacate Grand Prix 1959 through 1961, and first lightweight in the 1960 Big Bear Run.</p>

					<p class="section-paragraph">In 1958 Jaromir Cizek hit the road and totally dominated the European 250cc moto-cross championship (Coup d' Europe). Cizek won 9 Grand Prix in his way to the title. His Jawa, while appearing just like the production typ 557 250cc motocrosser, was in fact very special. It featured a short stroke engine (70mm bore x 64.5mm stroke) which was top secret at the time. Compared to the long stroke production engine this engine produced  more power and was quicker revving. Strangely Jawa never incorporated the short stroke design into their production moto-cross 250, but this bore and stroke configuration did resurface in the 250 banana frame ISDT bike of 1964.</p>

Cizek only managed a 5th place on the 4-stroke. The engine utilized a 4-stroke top end mated to the standard 2-stroke bottom end. The bike proved to be too heavy and under powered and the development was halted.</p>

It was produced in small numbers from 1963 to 1965 along with the 350cc version (typ 575/01). These bikes featured a totally new frame design unlike the Jawa road or ISDT bikes of the past. This model was lighter than the typ 557 it replaced at 254 LB.</p>

The photo at left shows the 1964 version which was raced by Vlastimil Valek and Peter Dobry in the 250cc GP’s that year. This bike featured a cassette gearbox which could be slid out the right side with the engine still in the frame. Likewise the crank shaft could be slid out the left side. The engine had a single exhaust port which emptied into two expansion chambers. Valek finished 7th in the final GP standings for 1964, down from 2nd the year before, it was definitely a development year for the banana frame</p>
